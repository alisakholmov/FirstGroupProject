   <h1>Sex and the City </h1> 

   <img src="img/girls.jpg" alt="The girl">
    
    <p>It's an American romantic comedy-drama television series created by Darren Star and produced by HBO. Broadcast from 1998 until 2004, the original run of the show had a total of 94 episodes.</p> 
    <p>Throughout its six-year run, the show received contributions from various producers, writers, and directors, principally Michael Patrick King.</p>

    <p>Set and filmed in New York City and based on Candace Bushnell's 1997 book of the same name.<br>
    The show follows the lives of a group of four women : three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties who despite their different natures and ever-changing sex lives, remain inseparable and confide in each other.</p>

    <h2>Actors and actresses </h2>
     <p>Starring Sarah Jessica Parker (as Carrie Bradshaw) and co-starring Kim Cattrall (as Samantha Jones), Kristin Davis (as Charlotte York), and Cynthia Nixon (as Miranda Hobbes), the quirky series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as sexuality, safe sex, promiscuity, and femininity, while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships. The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers' way of exploring social life—from sex to relationships—through each of their four very different, individual perspectives. </p>
    <p>Sex and the City has received both acclaim and criticism for its subjects and characters, and is credited with helping to increase HBO's popularity as a network. The series has won several accolades, including seven of its 54 Emmy Award nominations, eight of its 24 Golden Globe Award nominations, and three of its 11 Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.</p><br> The series placed fifth on Entertainment Weekly's "New TV Classics" list, and has been listed as one of the best television series of all time by Time in 2007 and TV Guide in 2013.
    The series still airs in syndication worldwide. It spawned two feature films, Sex and the City (2008) and Sex and the City 2 (2010), and a prequel television series commissioned by The CW, The Carrie Diaries (2013–2014). </p>
